  // However, we used the upper approximation 'beta' of 'alpha'.  The idea
  // is that 'beta' slowly moves down to 'alpha' to smoothly initialize
  // the exponential moving average.  This technique was used in 'Splatz'.

  // We maintain 'beta = 2^-period' until 'beta < alpha' and then set it to
  // 'alpha'.  The period gives the number of updates this 'beta' is used.
  // So for smaller and smaller 'beta' we wait exponentially longer until
  // 'beta' is halfed again.  The sequence of 'beta's is
  //
  //   1,
  //   1/2, 1/2,
  //   1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4
  //   1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8,
  //   ...
  //
  //  We did not derive this formally, but observed it during logging.  This
  //  is in 'Splatz' but not published yet, e.g., was not in POS'15.
