// The 'propagate' function is usually the hot-spot of a CDCL SAT solver.

// conflict or whether they produce additional assignments (units).

// This version of 'propagate' uses lazy watches and keeps two watched
// literals at the beginning of the clause.  We also use 'blocking literals'
// to reduce the number of times clauses have to be visited (2008 JSAT paper
// by Chu, Harwood and Stuckey).  The watches know if a watched clause is
// binary, in which case it never has to be visited.  If a binary clause is
// falsified we continue propagating.

// Finally, for long clauses we save the position of the last watch
// replacement in 'pos', which in turn reduces certain quadratic accumulated
// propagation costs (2013 JAIR article by Ian Gent) at the expense of four
// more bytes for long clauses (where it does not matter much).
