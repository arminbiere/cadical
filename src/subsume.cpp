// small enough glue to be otherwise kept forever (see 'opts.keepsize' and
// 'opts.keeglue', e.g., a redundant clause is not extended and thus kept if
// its size is smaller equal to 'opts.keepsize' or its glue is smaller equal
// than 'opts.keepsize').  Note, that 'forward' means that the clause from
// which the subsumption check is started is checked for being subsumed by
// other (smaller or equal size) clauses.  Since 'vivification' is an
// extended version of subsume, more powerful, but also slower, we schedule
// 'vivify' right after 'subsume', which in contrast to 'subsume' is not run
// until to completion (even though it only works on irredundant clauses).
