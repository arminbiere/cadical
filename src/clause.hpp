// The 'Clause' data structure is very important. There are usually many
// clauses and accessing them is a hot-spot.  Thus we use three common
// optimizations to reduce their memory foot print and improve cache usage.
// Even though this induces some complexity in understanding the actual
// implementation, arguably not the usage of this data-structure, we
// consider these optimizations as essential.
//
//   (1) The most important optimization is to 'embed' the actual literals
//   in the clause.  This requires a variadic size structure and thus
//   strictly is not 'C' conform, but supported by all compilers we used.
//   The alternative is to store the actual literals somewhere else, which
//   not only needs more memory but more importantly also requires another
//   memory access and thus is very costly.
//
//   (2) The boolean flags only need one bit each and thus there is enough
//   space left to merge them with a 'glue' bit field (which is less often
//   accessed than 'size').  This saves 4 bytes and also keeps the header
//   without '_pos' field (and alignment) nicely in 8 bytes.  We currently
//   use 21 bits and, actually, since we do not want to mess with 'unsigned'
//   versus 'signed' issues just use 20 out of them.  If more boolean flags
//   are needed this number has to be adapted accordingly.
//
//   (3) Clauses with size at least 'opts.posize' have a '_pos' field, which
//   contains  the position of the last exchanged watch in a long clause.
//   This field is only present if 'extended' is true.  Saving in '_pos'
//   starts making sense for clauses of length 4 and we usually have
//   'opts.keepsize == 3'.
//
// With these three optimizations a binary clause only needs 16 bytes
// instead of 44 bytes.  The last two optimizations reduce memory usage of
// very large formulas measurably but are otherwise not that important.
//
// If you want to add few additional boolean flags, add them after the
// sequence of already existing ones.  This makes sure that these bits and
// the following 'glue' field are put into a 4 byte word by the compiler. Of
// course you need to adapt 'LD_MAX_GLUE' accordingly.  Adding one flag
// reduces it by one.
//
// Additional fields needed for all clauses are safely put between 'glue'
// and 'size' without the need to change anything else.  In general these
// optimizations are local to 'clause.[hc]pp' and otherwise can be ignored
// except that you should for instance never access '_pos' of a clauses
// which is not extended.  This can be checked with for instance 'valgrind'
// but is also guarded by making the actual '_pos' field private and
// checking this contract in the 'pos ()' accessors functions.
