// Since 'ElimSchedule' needs the declaration of the 'heap' container, we
// have to include it here.  This is an exception to the policy of not
// including any header files in other header files than 'internal.hpp'.  In
// principle another possible fix would be to place the include directive
// for this file 'elim.hpp' after 'heap.hpp' but that is violating the other
// policy we have, which tries to keep the include directives in
// 'internal.hpp' alphabetically sorted.
